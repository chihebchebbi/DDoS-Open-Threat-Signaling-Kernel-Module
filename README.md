# DDoS-Open-Threat-Signaling-Kernel-Module

The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to provide a
   protocol to facilitate interoperability between multivendor DDoS
   mitigation solutions and services.  This document presents use cases
   which describe the interactions expected between the DOTS components
   as well as DOTS messaging exchanges.  The purpose of describing use
   cases is to identify the interacting DOTS components, how they
   collaborate and what are the types of information to be exchanged.
